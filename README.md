## About
The mod simply renders the solar system planets in Minecraft's skybox during the night. In a way, the MC skybox is a planetarium if you think about it.
The planet textures are made by @Crackers0106 (PR https://github.com/woodiertexas/planetarium/pull/1) and @lxly9 (PR https://github.com/woodiertexas/planetarium/pull/2).

## About Ports
I personally welcome third party ports to previous minecraft versions, but I respectfully ask that all third party ports remain Quilt exclusive. That means no ports to (neo)Forge, Fabric or any other non-Quilt modloader.
